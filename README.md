# About
I am a software developer from Ohio currently working at Grathwol Automation developing telematics software and web applications.
My main specialty is building web applications using Python/Flask on the backend with JavaScript/Vue.js on the frontend.
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Cleveland State University in 2016.
Some of my other interests include music, guitar, sailing, gaming, and electronics.
